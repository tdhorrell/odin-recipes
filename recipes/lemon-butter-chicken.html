    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These delicious lemon garlic chicken thighs are low carb, keto friendly, and easy enough for a weeknight meal. Guaranteed to impress the pickiest eaters! Serve over egg noodles, mashed potatoes, rice, or alongside your favorite vegetables.</p>
    <p>The lemon brings tart acid to balance out the richness from the chicken thighs and butter. I make it and pour the remaining sauce over rice most often.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tbsp butter, divided</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>4 &#40;8oz&#41; skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 &deg;F &#40;190 &deg;C&#41;</li>
        <li>Place 3 tbsp butter in a microwave-safe bowl and heat in a microwave oven until melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Smash garlic cloves with the side of a chef's knife and add garlic to the warm butter. Stir in lemon juice and onion powder; set aside</li>
        <li>Sprinkle both sides of chicken thighs with salt and pepper. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a medium oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Brown chicken, skin-side down, for 3 to 4 minutes. Flip chicken over and brush skin with lemon-butter mixture. Pour remaining butter mixture into skillet and remove from heat</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Brush skin every 10 minutes with pan juices</li>
        <li>Remove skillet from the oven and place chicken on a serving platter. Drizzle chicken with pan juices and garnish with parsleyRemove skillet from the oven and place chicken on a serving platter. Drizzle chicken with pan juices and garnish with parsley</li>
