    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Believe it or not, you don't need a deep fryer to make the best Buffalo wings of your life. These sports bar-worthy wings are as crispy as it gets (thanks to an hour of refrigeration time before they hit the oven), but they don't require any oil; and they don't make a mess of your kitchen.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>20 chicken wings</li>
        <li>1/2 cup melted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup hot pepper sauce (like Frank's RedHot)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and lightly grease with cooking spray</li>
        <li>Place flour, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and salt into a resealable plastic bag, and shake to mix. Add chicken wings, seal the bag, and toss until well coated with the flour mixture</li>
        <li>Transfer wings to the prepared baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 1 hour</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 &deg;F (200 degrees C)</li>
        <li>While the oven is preheating, whisk together melted butter and hot sauce in a small bowl</li>
        <li>Dip wings into butter mixture, and place back on the baking sheet</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Flip wings and continue to cook until crispy on the outside and no longer pink in the center, about 25 more minutes</li>
    </ol>
